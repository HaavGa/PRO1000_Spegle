      "Welcome to Spegle Hyllandsfoss in the heart of Telemark.With Hyllandshylen and Hyllandsfossen as the nearest neighbors, the place is idyllic and peaceful. The waterfall is normally regulated, but when the lake is towed from Totak and down the watercourse, it is a spectacular sight. The place is an excellent starting point for all experiences within outdoor life, culture, local food and sports activities in the area. You can also use the bathing boat Fl√∏tarhuset, which also has glass walls that reflect the surrounding landscape There are nice hiking trails near the place, and you can fish for free with a rod in Hylen. In winter, there are ski runs in the woods right behind the cabins. No reception, but digital check-in.",
